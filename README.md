# Employee Registration System

This project, developed by Group3 - Sebastian Dakey, Niyomwungeri Parmenide Ishimwe, and Himbaza Jules Bienvenue, is an employee registration system developed in Jaava Programming, that allows employers to onboard employees easily and manage their information. The system is designed to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of employee data, ensuring they are accurate, complete, and protected.

## Problem Statement

Employee management is crucial for any organization, and an employee registration system is a technology solution used to enter and maintain the records of employees within an organization. Given that these systems allow employers to enter employee information quickly, track engagement, and generate reports and insights, it is easy for employers to comply with regulations any time regulators show up. This project aims to design and implement an employee registration system to enable employers to manage their employees' information effectively.

## Requirements and Analysis

### Functional Requirements

* The system should allow a user to enter a new employee information
* A user should be able to view key information about every employee in the organization
* A user should be able to view basic statistics of all the employees in the organizations

### Non-functional Requirements

* The system should be reliable
* The system should be easy to use
* The system must have high-quality performance

## System Architecture

The project was developed using the Java programming language, leveraging its libraries as well as creating custom classes. The following are the classes used and created for the project:

* Employee Class - contains all the attributes and methods related to an employee.
* EmployeeDatabase Class - contains the database (hashmap) for storing the details of employees and methods for creating, getting, and generating basic statistics.
* EmployeeRegistration Class - contains the graphical user interface that enables employee registration.
* DisplayEmployee Class - contains the graphical user interface that displays information about employees in the system.
* DisplayEmployeeStats Class - contains the graphical user interface that enables basic statistics of employee data to be shown.
* Welcome Class - contains the graphical user interface that contains buttons leading to employee registration, display of employee information, and basic statistics of an employee.

## Methodology

The project was developed using the agile methodology of software development, employing an iterative development cycle that accommodates changing requirements as the code is developed.

## Plan for Future Work

To make the system even more robust, the team plans to add the following features in future development:

* Sign-up/sign-in feature
* UI improvement
* Time attendance and leave management
* Self-service portal to allow employees to update their information as when it changes
* Employee database management

## Conclusion

This employee registration system is a robust system that enables employers to onboard employees easily and manage their information effectively. The project was developed using the agile methodology of software development, and future work will be focused on adding more features to make the system even more robust.
